This project is the one requested for the MPRI course "Foundation of proof
systems" (MPRI 2.7.1).

It contains two independant Coq proofs:
- arith.v contains a formalization of Peano and Heyting arithmetic, a proof that
Heyting arithmetic is consistent in Coq (with reflection of Heyting arithmetic),
and the proof through Friedman-translation that Peano arithmetic is
Pi_0^2-conservative over Heyting arithmetic.

- while.v contains verified computation of the weakest preconditions for the
language While. See the [task description (in French)](http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/MPRI/2-7-1/wp.pdf) ([mirror](http://web.archive.org/web/20171206181734/http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/MPRI/2-7-1/wp.pdf)).
